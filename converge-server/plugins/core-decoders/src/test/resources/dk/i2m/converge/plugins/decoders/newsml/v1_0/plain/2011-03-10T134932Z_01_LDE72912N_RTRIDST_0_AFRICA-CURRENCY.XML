                                <p> NAIROBI, March 10 (Reuters) - Kenya's shilling is likely to
fall even further into record territory next week unless the
central bank decides to halt its dramatic slide by selling
dollars. Uganda's shilling is also seen under pressure.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> KENYA</p>
                                <p> The shilling &lt;KES=&gt; is likely to fall further after hitting
an all-time low due to the rising cost of fuel imports and a
stated policy of non-intervention from the central bank.</p>
                                <p> Commercial banks quoted the currency of east Africa's
biggest economy at 84.15/25 to the dollar -- its lifetime low --
compared with last Thursday's close of 83.05/15.</p>
                                <p> "We are in uncharted waters. Anything is possible. If demand
remains unabated and the sentiments for a weaker shilling
remain, nothing will stop it from hitting 85.00," said Chris
Muiga, senior trader at Kenya Commercial Bank.</p>
                                <p> The central bank stayed out of the foreign exchange market
on Thursday. Its stated policy throughout the shilling's
dramatic six-week slide is not to intervene unless it sees
speculation driving the currency in either direction.</p>
                                <p> "The feeling is that central bank does not have enough
reserves to intervene, but what are the reserves for? According
to me, they are to stabilise exchange rates," Muiga said.</p>
                                <p> Central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung'u said on Wednesday
intervention was not an option.</p>
                                <p> "Intervention always signals uncertainty which, on one hand,
leads to speculation or on the other hand puts true investors
into a wait-and-see mode," he said in a statement.</p>
                                <p> Traders said rising global oil prices due to turmoil in
Middle East and North Africa had made Kenyan oil importers
jittery.</p>
                                <p> "Oil importers are forward covering on fear that oil prices
in the international market would keep rising. This has
pressured the shilling further," said Sameer Lagadia, head of
trading at Diamond Trust Bank.</p>
                                <p> Traders said they expect the shilling to trade in the
84.00-84.80 range against the dollar into next week.</p>
                                <p> The shilling has dropped 10 percent against the dollar over
the last 12 months and 3 percent over the last 12 sessions.
Charts put it in a long-term downtrend. [ID:nLDE71R0ZE]</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> UGANDA</p>
                                <p> Uganda's shilling &lt;UGX=&gt; is expected to weaken towards a
record low, hurt by dropping dollar supplies from aid
organisations. Central bank dollar sales are not expected to
have much effect on the foreign currency squeeze.</p>
                                <p> Commercial banks quoted the unit at 2,380/2,385 to the
dollar versus last Thursday's close of 2,369/2,374.</p>
                                <p> "Most inflows that I monitor come from non-governmental
organisations but lately there's been a significant drop from
that source," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at
Barclays Bank Uganda.</p>
                                <p> He forecast the shilling would trade in a narrow range of
2,380 - 2,400 in the week ahead. The unit hit a record low of
2,395/2,400 in late January amid jitters about a February
presidential election that passed off largely without incident.</p>
                                <p> Analysts said falling dollar proceeds arose from diminishing
export earnings from food and coffee exports.</p>
                                <p> The Bank of Uganda sold an undisclosed amount of foreign
exchange on Thursday, but does not appear to have a target level
in mind.</p>
                                <p> "Bank of Uganda doesn't wait for any particular level to
intervene. What it doesn't want is extreme volatility which
happened between yesterday evening and today morning," Bukenya
said. "In that short period the shilling lost 10 shillings."</p>
                                <p> The currency's 14-day and 50-day simple moving averages show
the shilling staying on a weakening trend in the short run.</p>
                                <p> In the last 12 months, it has lost more than 15 percent
against the dollar.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> TANZANIA</p>
                                <p> Tanzania's shilling &lt;TZS=&gt; may ease slightly due to foreign
investors wishing to repatriate dividend payments.</p>
                                <p> Commercial banks quoted the local currency at 1,510/1,515
compared with 1,513/1,518 a week ago, and traders said it should
trade in a 1,510-1,520 trade in the days ahead.</p>
                                <p> "We are heading towards the end of the first quarter. Most
of the corporates are more concerned about making their first
quarter tax payments at the moment," said Bruno Ngooh, a trader
at Standard Chartered Bank Tanzania.</p>
                                <p> Traders said the central bank had been active, selling an
average of $8.7 million each day.</p>
                                <p> "The shilling should remain in the same levels until the end
of the month, but it could weaken next month when some companies
start to pay dividends to offshore shareholders," Ngooh added.</p>
                                <p> The shilling is down nearly 12 percent against the dollar
over the last 12 months, but is trading off a four-month low of
1,518 hit in late February.</p>
                                <p> Between last Thursday and Wednesday, the central bank traded
$42.8 million on its Interbank Foreign Exchange Market, its
website said.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> NIGERIA</p>
                                <p> The naira &lt;NGN=D1&gt; could weaken further towards 155.00 to
the U.S. dollar amid strong demand for the greenback from
bureaux de change outlets and dwindling inflows from energy
multinationals.</p>
                                <p> The naira was at 154.67 early on Thursday, compared to
154.36 at Wednesday's close, with more demand coming from some
lenders funding bureaux de change outlets and covering unmet
demand at the central bank's bi-weekly forex auction.</p>
                                <p> At the official window on Wednesday, demand outstripped
supply, with the central bank coming up $70 million short,
putting further pressure on dollars at the interbank market.</p>
                                <p> "The naira should depreciate further in the next couple of
weeks until there are inflows from the energy companies," one
dealer said.</p>
                                <p> Increased demand for dollars at the official auction came
from gasoline importers placing orders for their next shipments
of fuel into the country, traders said.</p>
                                <p> Nigeria's foreign reserves rose 8.6 percent to $36.38
billion from the end of February to March 8, increasing the
ability of Africa's top energy producer to support its currency.</p>
                                <p> Dealers said the bureaux de change pressure could mean some
individuals building up a stock of dollars in case of political
trouble in the run-up to an April election.</p>
                                <p> "Most corporate institutions are not buying dollars at the
present level because they prefer to pass their bids through the
official window. It's the informal sector that is driving the
current high demand," another dealer said.</p>
                                <p> "The naira should trade around 155 to the dollar by next
week unless there is a large inflow of dollars."</p>
                                <p> The naira spiked to a record low of 158 against the dollar
in early 2009 after a sharp depreciation from around 118 caused
by the global financial crisis.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> GHANA</p>
                                <p> The cedi &lt;GHS=&gt; is likely to stay range-bound, but with a
slight weakening bias.</p>
                                <p> The unit was at 1.5205/30 to the dollar on Thursday,
stronger than its record lows beyond 1.57 but weaker than the
mid 1.40s it enjoyed for much of last year.</p>
                                <p> "I expect the trend to continue. We see very firm corporate
demand in the coming week and the supply side is weak," said
Jacob Brobbey from Barclays Ghana's treasury department. "The
rate is gradual so it won't cause too much alarm for
policymakers."</p>
                                <p> Access Bank's Biggles Amponsah said the cedi should ease
slightly as companies in manufacturing and consumer import
sector bought dollars to pay for bills fall due at the end of
the first quarter.</p>
                                <p> "I expect the cedi to trade at around 1.5240 next week," he
said.</p>

                                <p> The kwacha &lt;ZMK=&gt; may come under pressure due to resurfacing
concerns about European debt souring sentiment to riskier
emerging market securities.</p>
                                <p> Commercial banks on Thursday quoted the currency of Africa's
top copper producer at 4,740 versus 4,715 a week ago.</p>
                                <p> "We expect the kwacha to be under pressure around
4,740-4,800 mainly because of the debt crisis in Europe," one
trader said.</p>
                                <p> Standard Chartered said the kwacha would stick around 4,750
for the first of half of the year before pushing towards a key
support resistance level of 4,650 in the second half.</p>
                                <p> The kwacha should benefit from buoyant copper prices, a
trade surplus, rising foreign direct investment, low inflation,
low interest rates and high foreign exchange reserves, the bank
added.</p>
                                <p> Zambia's currency met firm resistance around 4,600 during
2010. On the few occasions it breached that level, it went on to
test but failed to breach 4,550. </p>
