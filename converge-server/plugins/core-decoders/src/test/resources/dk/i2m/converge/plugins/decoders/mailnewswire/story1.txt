'Hey Soul Sister' iTunes best-selling single of 2010

That October campaign to ban "Hey Soul Sister" from being used in advertisements certainly didn't make the song any less popular: Apple has announced that the Train single was iTunes's best-selling single of 2010.

Entertainment Weekly reports that "Hey Soul Sister" was the most downloaded song on the music service, with Katy Perry's "California Gurls" and Eminem's "Love the Way You Lie" rounding out the top three.

As Marquee previously reported, Brad Meyers and Keith Stoeckeler created the website Stop Advertising From Pulling a Train after hearing "Hey Soul Sister" in everything from Samsung 3D TV ads, the trailer for the Katherine Heigl/Josh Duhamel flick "Life As We Know It," and even a breast cancer PSA.

Meanwhile, Eminem fared much better on iTunes's album chart. His CD, "Recovery," was the top seller, with Ke$ha's "Animal" and Lady Gaga's "The Fame" landing at Nos. 2 and 3, respectively.
